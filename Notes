Gherkin language

Scenario
Given - pre condition
When - action we need to perform
And - supporting tag
Then - expected results

---------------------------------------
What is framework?
-- it is an organized structure of folders and packages which allows us to write clean and maintainable code

build management tool.
-- maven
pom.xml is the main configuration file in maven project.

main --- it is used to write the code for development
test --- it is used to write the code to test the application
  -- java - for tech/coding we use java directory
  -- resources - for non tech/non code we use resources

 cucumber as  a tool  -- cucumber as a framework

  cucumber - it supports BDD (Behavior  Driven Development)
    -- we use gherkin language ( plain english text) to write the scenarios
    -- it works with junit

  Scenario --  it is test case       * 1 Scenario  1 test case *
  Given -- pre condition
  When -- actions
  And -- supporting tag
  Then -- expected results

 --- User story---
 US 12345 - Employee search

 Scenario - Search employee by id
 Given user is navigated to HRMS Application
 When user enters valid admin credentials
 And user clicks on login button
 And user navigates to employee list page
 When user enters valid employee id
 And click on search button
 Then user is able to see employee information

 Scenario - search employee by name
  Given user is navigated to HRMS Application
  When user enters valid admin credentials
  And user clicks on login button
  And user navigates to employee list page
  When user enters valid name
  And click on search button
  Then user is able to see employee information

  file where we write BDD scenarios is feature file
  this file has  .feature extension
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Class 3

  We use feature file to write our  scenarios
  -- search employee by id
  -- search employee by name

  in feature file we write scenarios using gherkin language
  --Given, when ,and, then, scenario, feature

  after feature file , we need to create step definition
  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  class 4
  Commom methods class in our framework  is used to write all the methods we will be using in
   majority of scenarios (Code usability)

 sendText method, click, etc

 in constants class we provide implicit wait, explicit wait

 page object model--- design pattern
 According to page object model, we create page classes for all the screens available in the application
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Class 5

 Creating multiple steps classes for multiple feature files.

 Page object model design pattern

in common methods we are calling page initializers methods, this method is going to call the object
of page classes which will call the constructor and these constructors will initialize all the WebElements
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Class 6

Runner class - we use this class to execute test cases in cucumber

cucumber options:
-- features - path of feature file
-- glue - to provide the path of steps definition
-- dryRun - it provides step definition to add steps classes
-- monochrome - if it is set to true, it cleans the console from inrelevant information's
-- tags - we use tags to execute scenarios in groups
     -- here we use OR and AND to execute scenarios from 2 or more different tags together

Background: we take common steps from scenarios and put them in the background only if they not breaking flow

Hooks we use hooks to provide pre condition and post condition to all the scenarios
We always create hooks in steps packege

Background vs hooks:
background - it is applicable to one feature file
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Class - 7

-- recap
--------- hooks - to write pre conditions and post conditions of the project, we use hooks.
@before and @after - 2 types of hooks we have in cucumber
we always write hooks under steps package

--
Data driven testing part -
-- using examples table and scenario outline
-- using data table
--

Class 8-9

maven surefire plugin


to clean the project - mvn clean from cmd/terminal
to run the project - mvn test from cmd/terminal
override the tags from cmd - mvn clean verify -Dcucumber.filter.tags="@latest"

mvn clean - it cleans your target folder
mvn test -  to execute our test cases
verify - verifies your code
package - convert your code to packages
